    "In this notebook you will work with preprocessed 2 photon calcium recordings, that have already been converted into spike counts for a population of cells from the Macaque V1. During the experiment the animal has been presented with several drifting grating stimuli, in response to which the neural activity was recorded. In this exercise sheet we will study how you can visualize the activity of multiple neural spike trains and assess whether a neuron is selective to a specific stimulus type.\n",

We recommend you to use a subset of the data for testing and debugging, ideally focus on a single cell (e.g. cell number x). The spike times and stimulus conditions are read in as pandas data frames. You can solve the exercise by making heavy use of that, allowing for many quite compact computations. See [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) and several good [tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python#gs.L37i87A) on how to do this. Of course, converting the data into classical numpy arrays is also valid."
