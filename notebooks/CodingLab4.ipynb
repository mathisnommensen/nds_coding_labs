During the experiment the animal has been presented with several drifting grating stimuli, in response to which the neural activity was recorded. In this exercise sheet we will study how you can visualize the activity of multiple neural spike trains and assess whether a neuron is selective to a specific stimulus type.\n",

You can solve the exercise by making heavy use of that, allowing for many quite compact computations. See [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) and several good [tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python#gs.L37i87A) on how to do this.
